# Sentiment Analysis with LSTMs



## This repository contains the training data on sentiment analysis with LSTMs in Tensorflow. In this project, I focused on classifying tweets as either positive, negative, or neutral.   

## there are many new methods that are being introduced such as Bidirectional Long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), emotion-enhanced LSTM, known as ELSTM, Memristive LSTM. Most of the research papers use a different type of Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, each has its own limitations, and these limitations lead to a new discovery of LSTM.   

## I used a sequence model that can perform Twitter sentiment analysis to categorize a tweet as Positive or Negative using Word2Vec and Bi-LSTM. With recurrent neural network models, I achieved an accuracy of 82% in Bi-LSTM, and we got an accuracy of 81% in the LSTM model. The RNN modelâ€™s accuracy was 79%.
